# EstateGame

The vision of this project is to create a game (set with the same rules of the card game Gwent&copy;) with a developers theme in mind.
It's called "EstateGame" since Estate is the internet company I work for and it's eventually meant to be played by every member of Estate.
Maybe in the future we can set up Company vs Company matches.
                                                    
Development
-----------
Everything is build with the Framework Meteor. It caught my attention in 2013 by a tutorial from Andrew Burgess on Tutsplus.com.
This whole development is meant to turn my skills up a notch, since I haven't developed anything since then. 

Used languages and frameworks
-----------------
Since Meteor is a JavaScript framework, JavaScript is at it's core of this web application. This will create a realtime multiplayer cross-device game. I chose Twitter's Bootstrap framework since I think it beats the other ones at this moment, but it also speeds up my Front-end work.

**Here is a list of the knowledge needed to pull this off**

1. HTML5 (d0h!)
2. CSS3 (mostly for transitions, animation and shaders)
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery
5. jQueryUI
6. Meteor
7. Angular
8. MongoDB
																	
Design
----
At the end I will be mostly working on the graphics. I'm planning to create some real intuitive interactions which give a good visual feedback. The total sum should give the user a feeling of a real game instead of a website.
